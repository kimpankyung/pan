# Starting Data
•     Coordinate file for receptor (in a variety of formats, including pdb, mol2, cif & sdf)

•     Coordinate file for ligand (in a variety of formats, including pdb, mol2, cif & sdf)

•     Several files are available in Supplementary Data for use as a tutorial for each of 
      the protocols: 1iep_receptorH.pdb (coordinates of c-Abl kinase domain from PDB 
      entry 1iep, with hydrogen atoms added in AutoDockTools), 1iep_ligandH.pdb 
      (coordinates of imatinib from PDB entry 1iep, with hydrogen atoms added in 
      AutoDockTools), 1fpu_receptorH.pdbqt (coordinates of c-Abl kinase domain from 
      PDB entry 1fpu, in PDBQT format), imatinib.pdbqt (coordinates of imatinib in 
      PDBQT format), NCIdivII_subset (a folder that includes 499 compounds from the 
      ZINC library, formatted as PDBQT files)
